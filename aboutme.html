                🔨 Once an ironworker, I retrained as a software developer and found my true passion in Java programming. I have expertise in Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Maven, and Java EE, and I'm always eager to expand my skillset. <br>

                🚀 My work revolves around building APIs and web applications, and I have contributed to several exciting projects including a Netflix clone, an Instagram clone, and an e-commerce website. I love solving complex problems and creating efficient and elegant solutions. <br>
                
                👨‍💻 I honed my skills at BeCode, where I followed web development with a specialization in Java software development. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the industry. <br>
                
                🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest advancements in video game technology or playing my favorite games. I also enjoy hiking and dog training as a way to stay active and clear my mind.</p>
